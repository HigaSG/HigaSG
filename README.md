### About me

Hello! My name is Alfredo Riyuji Higa and I'm 17 years old. 

Currently, I'm studying programming at Alura and I'm excited to become a full-stack developer. I have experience in various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm also learning frameworks like React and Node.js. I'm constantly looking to learn new skills and improve my existing ones. 

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects, and get in touch with me if you want to discuss collaborations or job opportunities. Thank you for visiting my profile!
